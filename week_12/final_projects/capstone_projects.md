# Capstone Projects

<em>"Also called a capstone experience, culminating project, or senior exhibition, among many other terms, a capstone project is a multifaceted assignment that serves as a culminating academic and intellectual experience for students"</em>

## Objective

The aim of this project is for you to spend a more prolonged period of time working on a project you are interested in. You should come up with an idea for your project, maybe some app you have in mind that you'd like to create, or maybe some area that you are interested in.

You can choose to use any of the languages and technologies taught on the course, or you can use this as an opportunity to go and learn about a language and/or technology which you are interested in.

## Brief

* Once you have an idea for your project you will need to complete a Project Scope document (See project_scope_sample.pdf)
  * This brief will need to detail the MVP and extensions.
  * Be extremely careful to not bite off more than you can handle - but be adventurous 
  * Show it to instructors for sign-off
  

* Chat and share your project ideas in Slack 
* Send the instructors your repo links!
  * Add your brief into the root README.md file for the repo. 
  * One repo for your entire project


* Presentations on Friday - **please send us your song**
* Choose your own team - no bigger than 4
* Solo is an option - by all means

## Rules

### README

Your README on your Github repo is important. A well done README indicates to employers that you care about your project and can communicate it to other developers. A good README will include things such as project logo, clear description, screenshot, step-by-step installing instructions etc. See <https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme> for guidance.

### Tech

* Choose your own tech stack - this is a chance for you to learn about something which interests you.
* We heavily encourage 3rd party libraries or frameworks of all kinds - you choose. Explore some ideas - we're **really** keen to see what you find. If you do, it makes a great topic for the presentation. Examples include ( see "awesome" lists below for even more inspiration )
  * MongoDB for JPA
  * React Native
  * Reactive for Spring Boot
  * Django
  * Socket.IO / RSocket / WebSockets etc
  * Semantic UI for React
  * Tailwind CSS for React
  * Styled Components for React
* Be careful with things like React Native and Swift - they are fun but can often take longer to build. 


### Notice Board

If you (individually) have an idea for a project and would like to be in a group, we'd love it if you could advertise or pitch your idea to recruit other students to your project. Sell your idea and be open to suggestions on how it could be mixed around and changed. **We would love to see a hive of activity on slack discussing this  - get pitching :D**

Even if you don't have an idea, but maybe want to work on a particular technology or library - please bring along your thoughts and share with others as there could be a really good match. Tell people what tech you want to work on if there's something that takes your fancy  and feel free to share that on Slack, too.

## Project Tech Exploration Ideas


- <https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react> - An excellent curated list of awesome React libraries.
- <https://github.com/phodal/awesome-iot-projects> - A curated list of awesome IoT projects and ideas.
- <https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java> - An excellent curated list of awesome Java libraries.
- <https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python> - An excellent curated list of awesome Python libraries, frameworks and resources.
- <https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript> - An excellent curated list of awesome JS libraries covering both front-end and back-end.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - A tool for allowing you to package up your app into a container.


### APIs

- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) - A platform that has production-grade instant messaging and video conferencing API’s.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - A platform for adding payment for almost any payment type or currency to your app. Has API’s and libraries for allowing payments, setting up subscriptions etc. Also has extremely good developer mode that means you can “pay” for stuff in your app with fake card details and see it work the way it would in production.
- [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/)  -  Platform (owned by Twillio, actually) for allowing you to generate and send emails via API. Has libraries for most languages.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)- Tool for creating visualisations of data for analytics / monitoring purposes

As usual, the instructors will be available if you need help but note that if you decide to go and learn a new language technology then the instructors might not be able to be of much assistance if they have little or no knowledge of the language/technology you decide to go with. The upside of this is that it gives you a chance to show that you are a self-learner, which will be a great asset when working in the industry.

### PDA Reminder:

If you haven't already done these parts of the PDA, as part of this project take screenshots of the following:

```
 - Two system interaction diagrams (sequence and/or collaboration diagrams).
 - Two object diagrams.
 - Select two algorithms you have written (NOT the group project). Take a screenshot of each and write a short statement on why you have chosen to use those algorithms.
 - Produce a bug tracking report.
```

- Go to your [PDA Checklist](https://github.com/codeclan/pda/tree/master/Evidence%20Gathering%20Portfolio)

- Submit your PDA evidence (screenshots, etc.) to your own PDA repo

- PDA Reference: P7, P8, P9, P17
