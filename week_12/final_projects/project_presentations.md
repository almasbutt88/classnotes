# Project Presentations

Each presentation should be 10 minutes MAXIMUM with 5 minutes for questions

If you're working in a group, all members of the group should be involved in presenting.

 - Describe the brief 
 - Show us the app running
 - Show your planning
 - Show some code you are particularly proud of i.e. do not take us through every line of code
 - Describe your main learning points

The code you show running should be the version of the code on your main branch of your Github repo. That is all working branches should have been merged so that if anyone clones your code from Github then if they build and run the main branch, then it should be the same as the code you present.

***Remember*** to send us your song choice
