# Inheritance Teach Back

You have 25 minutes to prepare a lesson (with examples) to teach to the rest of the class. One group will be picked at random to deliver their lesson.

Here are some questions to prompt you. You don't have to stick strictly to these:

- What are the 4 Pillars of OO?
- Describe Inheritance
- Why can it be useful?
- Draw a class diagram that includes inheritance
- Create a code example of inheritance (you could use Vehicle, Car, Motorbike or think of your own)
- What is a super-class?
- What is a sub-class?
- What is overriding?
- What does the `super` keyword mean?
- What are the problems with inheritance?
